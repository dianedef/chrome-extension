This tag is dedicated to questions about extension development for the Google Chrome web browser.

The Chrome extension API is documented here.

Absolute beginners should start here.

A good tutorial video by official Google Developers is available on YouTube

Overview of extension architecture can be read here.

The What's New page lists some of the recent changes to the extension APIs, while the Official Chrome Releases Blog announces new releases of Chrome and Chrome OS. For general updates on the browser, visit the Official Chrome Blog.

Troubleshooting
Before posting a question, make sure that you've read the API documentation. If some methods are not documented, it may be because they are deprecated.

If necessary, include relevant parts of your manifest.json file in the question.

A common source of errors is the misunderstanding of manifest version 2 and Content Security policy (CSP). Read the documentation for the CSP to see if it answers to your question.

For anything not related to development of Chrome extensions, such as issues with publishing in the Chrome Web Store, browse the Chromium-extensions Google group (now read-only). Extension authors with questions about the Chrome Web Store can contact the cws-developer-support team at https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/contact/developer_support/.

Migration to Manifest Version 3
Manifest version 3 is now in support since chrome 88, and
will be allowed on the chrome webstore on January 2021. It
is recommended to read how to migrate from v2 to v3 and an
overview of the new features are found here.
